<p align="justify"> Magento 2 Gift Card extension allows store owners to create gift cards for customers to purchase and give their acquaintances as a present on special occasions. However, the problem comes from default Magento 2 Community Edition when it does not support gift card as a product. This product type only exists in Enterprise edition along with necessary functions to launch gift cards to the market. Hence, Magento 2 Gift Card extension solves this limitation by allowing admin to easily create gift card as a new product type with a system of code pattern, code generator, and management. Customers can buy gift cards, then send to other people via email or post office along with custom messages added in the purchase process. Store owners are provided with essential tools to keep track gift card purchases and even gift code usage.</p>
